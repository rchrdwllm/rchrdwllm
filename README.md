# Hello, I'm @rchrdwllm! 👋

I'm a web developer, 18 years old, and almost finishing senior high school!
I aim to be able to create interactive and awesome websites with focus on front-end development.
On a side note, I'm also interested in learning some back-end stuff.

- 👀 I’m interested in web development, software engineering, architecture, arts, and music
- 🌱 I’m currently learning web development
- 📐 I want to get into learning WebGL
